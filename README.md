## Summary
Based on the results from the NYC CitiBike analysis, investors in Des Moines should focus their initial promotions on signing up subscription riders, focusing on trips of ten minutes or less, and targeting weekday commuters (Monday to Friday, 8am, and 5-6pm).

The following two additional visualizations are recommended in order to strengthen this analysis: 1) Duration of Trip by Weekday by Hour, 2) Trips by Weekend by Hour (Saturday and Sunday).
